Welcome to the W. M. Keck Observatory exposure time calculator! This tool calculates SNR as a function of exposure time, or vice versa. 

This tool updates output products in realtime as you modify input parameters. Mouse over and click on the plots to see SNR or required exposure time at a wavelength of interest. The plots are interactive, use the tool bar on the upper right of the plots to zoom, reset, save plots, etc. Use the sliding bar in the Exposure pannel to adjust exposure time or SNR. The computed SNR is per unit resolution. Users can upload their own source SED in ECSV or FITS format for ETC calculations. The ETC uses cookies to save your calculations for up to 48 hours in case you close or reload the page. To reset to the default values, click the button on the top right of the page. To download the results of your calculations in CSV format, use the button on the bottom of the results panel on the right side of the page.
